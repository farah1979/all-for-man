# Design
## Project definition
  - The purpose of the site design ... In addition, it is the fourth and final project in the long and enjoyable way that I have crossed at the Code Institute Where it built in me a great challenge with codes and a greater passion in how to communicate with each code and brought me a very great benefit scientifically.
  But there is another goal in building a website specialized in cosmetics for men, as it is one of the projects that I want to achieve. It is owning a private project and expanding it to reach the world, and the topic covered by the site is closely related to the family, because many of us are beauticians and hairdressers, and for this I wanted to achieve my dream and the dream of my family.
  Due to the nature of the site and the target audience, which is the category of men . I used colors that are appropriate and close to the tastes of men in order to be able to attract them.
  As the colors that I used are wonderful colors and are a source of joy and the customer is eager to buy.
  I'll explain it in the color scheme.

## color scheme
This site was created on four main colors, ** black... dark gray... white and orange **,
Because they are the favorite colors of men and fit a lot with the type of products displayed on my website.
The reasons:
   1. Comfortable to the eye, which attracts the visitor to browse the site with a great desire.
   2. The orange color(*#bd5a18*) was inspired by the main image displayed on the front of the site as it merged and coordinated with the image wonderfully.
   3. Black and dark gray(*#000*, *#494949*) was used as the main color on the site because it reflects the black color, which is the master of colors and suits the taste of men. In addition to the dark gray, I used it as a base color in creating a logo for the site.
   4. White to open the page and give it beautiful glasses and movement, which attracts the viewer's attention.

## Typography
  - **Roboto font**: Is the main font used throughout the site with **Sans Serif** as the backup font In case the font isn't imported properly into the site for any reason from the google fonts, this font that I've used on all my pages is nice and clean font that's frequently used in programming, so it's attractive and appropriate.
  - The source for the inspired font is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Wireframe
  - All wireframes pages were created by mockflow-wireframe.I made a simple and concise layout of must of pages that I had created in the project, which are **Home, Product, Product-detail, Newsletters, Reviews, FAQ, Question-answer, View-question, Checkout, Checkout-success, Bag**.

## Imagery

All product images, data, and even prices are real and were taken from different suppliers that I have previously dealt with them.
The site's logo is inspired by the developer's imagination, as it is the logo that I will adopt on my site, which I think and plan to develop further and make it spread throughout Sweden first and the world second.
As for the images which published on the News and reviews page, they were taken after a continuous search on Google

  - product price
  - Product category
  -  Rating with star icon

With the help of the Python and Jinja language, the products were displayed easily, and each of them had its own place with its own data. All the products were added by the developer, who is at the same time the admin, and they were added manually on the admin page and through programming they were presented to the viewer with this beauty and elegance.<br>
Each card has its own clicking, which means that the visitor is allowed to simply click on the product card and enter the product detail page, where more details about this product will be shown to him. <br>

## Database Design
  - There are two databases that were used in the project
    - The first is Sqlite3, which is a virtual database that comes automatically after you install the django app. It was used throughout the construction period of the project
    - The second is PostgreSql, which is the database provided by Heroku that was used to deploy our project.
  - In the event of adding any new code to the project in git IDE then we must add, comment and push to Github and then automatically the code will be added to the page which deployed in heroku.
  - Django Allauth, specifically `django.contrib.auth.models` provided the **User** model that is used in the Profile App.
  - Django helped us a lot and made it easy for us to install any app we want to add to the site.
  - When you install any app by using python3 manage.py startapp (app name), it will come with a package of files, including:
    - Models, Admin, Test, View, apps and each file has a specific role.
  - With the help of the code institute Boutiq ado, many apps have been created, including the Home, Products, Profiles, Bag and checkout.
  - As the developer, I created 3 additional applications for the site, which are: Questions, Newsletters and Reviews.

# Deployment
This [ALL 4 MAN Website](https://all-for-man.herokuapp.com/) is hosted using Heroku, deployed directly from the main branch via GitHub.

Deployment of the site was achieved by following the steps below:
  - Created a new repository in GitHub.
  - Opened repository in my Git IDE.
  - Created a requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal. This tells Heroku what dependencies are required.
  - Created a Procfile and added `web: gunicorn all_for_man.wsgi:application` to the file.
  - Checked the Procfile to make sure there is no extra line after the first line as this can confuse Heroku.
  - Push the requirements.txt and Procfile to GitHub.
  - Logged into Heroku and selected "Create New App".
  - Selected the input field "App Name" and gave app a unique name using dashes instead of spaces.
  - Selected the region closest to my location and free to use!
  - Clicked "Create App".
  - Clicked "Resources" and typed in Postgres in the Add-ons search bar.
  - Selected Heroku Postgres and provisioned a free Hobby Dev database
  - Use this command to backup my current database and load it into a db.json file:
      - python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
  - Retrieved the Database URL from the hidden Config Vars in "Settings".
  - Pasted the Database URL in the database path in settings.py and removed the local settings.
  - Ran python3 manage.py showmigrations
  - Run pythons manage.py migrate to build the database in postgres
  - Then used this command to load my data from the db.json file into postgres:
     - python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
  - Created a superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser` and followed the instructions in the terminal.
  - Removed the Postgres Database URL so it didn't end up in version control.
  - Typed `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` in the terminal to stop Heroku collecting the static files.
  - Pushed all changes to GitHub.
  - Typed `git push heroku main` to push everything to Heroku.
  - Selected "Deploy" from the Heroku App menu.
  - Selected "GitHub" from the "Deployment Method" section of the page.
  - Ensured my GitHub profile name was showing in the "Connect to GitHub" section and inserted my GitHub repo name in the input field and clicked "Search".
  - Once Heroku had found my repo, I clicked "Connect" to complete the link.
  - Choosed Disply Automatic Deploys to allow all the changes that I make in IDE and pushed it to github will deploy automatic in heroku
  - Selected "Settings" from the Heroku App menu.
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY      | obtained from STRIPE                                                              |
-- Selected "Reveal Config Vars" and inputed the relevant key/value information for the AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, DATABASE_URL,  EMAIL_HOST_PASS , EMAIL_HOST_USER , SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WH_SECRET, and USE_AWS.
  - Once site was deployed, clicked "View" to launch the app and be able to view it within the browser.

### AWS S3

For the static css, js and media files to be stored and useable with Heroku, you need an AWS account.
  - Go to [AWS](aws.amazon.com) and either log in or create an account.
  -  Search for S3. 
  - Create a new bucket and ensure that the `Block All Public Access` tickbox is unchecked and click 'Create Bucket`.
  - Click on the Properties tab and enable `Static Website Hosting`. This will allow AWS to host our static files.
  - Input `index.html` and `error.html` in the appropriate fields and hit save.
  - Click on the Properties tab and click CORS configuration and add the correspondig cors info.
  - Click the Policy Tab and select Policy Generator which creates a security policy for the bucket.
  - The policy type is S3 Bucket Policy and the Action will be `get object`.
  - Copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) from the bucket and paste it in the ARN field.
  - Click `Add Statement` and then `Generate Policy`.
  - Copy the generated policy in to the Bucket Policy Editor.
  - Add `/*` at the end of the resource key as this will allow access to all resources in the bucket.
  - Click Save.
  - Click the Access Control tab and set the list object permission to everyone under the Public Access section.
  - Open IAM from the service menu.
  - Create a group for your user to belong to.
  - Create an access policy for you the group which gives access to the S3 bucket.
  - Click the JSON tab and select import managed policy, search for S3 and select S3 Full Access Policy.
  - Create a user, give them programmatic access and attach it to the group.
  - Download the CSV file that is generated as this contains the keys required to use AWS.
  - Install boto3 and django-storages using `pip3 install`.
  - Add the keys to the Config Vars in Django.
  - Create a custom_storage file.
  - Run `python manage.py collectstatic` and transfers the static info to AWS.
